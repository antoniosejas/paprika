#Paprika

##JavaScript framework for paper-based interaction in the browser

Paprika is an experimental framework exploring paper-based interaction as input for browser applications. It uses [Chilitags](https://github.com/chili-epfl/chilitags) fiducial markers in combination with [three.js](http://threejs.org/) to detect and model the manipulation of paper elements like cards.

The main goal of Paprika is to present an accessible abstraction model for paper interactions, allowing developers to easily work with augmented paper without prior knowledge of computer vision and the underlying technology at work.

##Content

* The main application code is contained within `js/paprika.js`.
* Basic usage examples for the different functions exist under `examples`.
* You can test the demos live on our [github.io page](http://chili-epfl.github.io/paprika/).
